* rsyncshot open
** [#A] help should be able to tell if installed or if setup needed
instructions should change based on install state
- if not installed, setup instructions are clear
- if installed, install and log location is clear
** [#B] backup drive should have an optional command line argument
reason: users may want to backup to a different directory via crontab or manually
default exists now (i.e., "/media/backup")
** [#B] crontab should have sane limits
monthly for a year
weekly for a month
daily for a week
hourly for a day
** [#C] all arguments should be optional
if nothing passed arguments are "backup 100"
** [#C] backup pruning should be more robust
perhaps use awk to identify files outside of range and delete via loop
* rsyncshot closed
** DONE [#B] backups should be contained in a subdirectory based on hostname
